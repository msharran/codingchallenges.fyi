### What is a State Machine?

A state machine is a behavioral design pattern. Think of it as a blueprint for an object that can be in one of a set of finite **states**. The machine can only be in **one state at a time**. It changes from one state to another in response to specific inputs or **events**. These changes are called **transitions**.

The core components are:
1.  **States**: The distinct conditions the system can be in (e.g., `Pending`, `Running`, `Failed`).
2.  **Transitions**: The rules that govern moving from one state to another. A transition is triggered by an event (e.g., "resource created," "process finished").
3.  **Actions**: The code that is executed when a state is entered, exited, or a transition occurs.

A simple analogy is a traffic light. It has three states: `Green`, `Yellow`, and `Red`. It transitions between them based on a timer event. It can't be both `Green` and `Red` at the same time.

### When to Use One (especially for Platform Engineers)

You should consider using a state machine when you have an object whose behavior changes dramatically based on its internal state, and this logic is becoming a complex mess of `if/else` or `switch` statements.

For your work, this is extremely common:

1.  **Controllers (like in Kubernetes)**: This is a perfect use case. A Kubernetes Pod is a state machine. It moves through states like `Pending`, `ContainerCreating`, `Running`, `Succeeded`, or `Failed`. The controller's job is to watch the pod's current state and take actions (like scheduling it on a node) to move it toward the desired state.

2.  **CLIs with complex flows**: For a simple CLI that takes a flag and exits, it's overkill. But for an *interactive* CLI (like `git rebase -i`) or a multi-step command, a state machine can manage the flow cleanly. For example, states could be `AwaitingInput`, `Processing`, `Confirming`, `Done`.

3.  **Parsing complex formats**: When you're reading a file or a network stream with a defined structure, a state machine is ideal. In fact, the `gotar` project you're in uses one. It has to read a header, then the file content, then the next header, and so on. The states are likely `ReadingHeader` and `ReadingContent`.

Using a state machine makes your code:
*   **Clearer**: The possible states and transitions are explicitly defined, making complex logic easy to visualize.
*   **More Robust**: It prevents illegal or impossible states.
*   **Easier to Maintain**: Adding a new state or changing a transition involves modifying a specific, isolated part of the code.
